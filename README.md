# Coursera-Angular-Testing
For my coursera course. Made public (For now) so I can host this stuff on github pages.

I really need to figure out how to rig this up with a package.json that allows me to npm install --save-dev angular.min.js@1.8.2 on new machines so I don't have to upload the thing into the github repo... Too lazy though...
